# Note for development:

**In order to run the project, follow these steps:**
- Angular (v13.3.3) + Node.js (v16.14.2) + npm (v8.5.0) installed
- backend/.env file created
- MongoDB server running, and its URI defined in .env
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` : **automatically** runs `ng serve` and `node server.js` using concurrency

### Tip: 

.env should look like this:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/collection_name //you created it ü´µ
PORT=port //3000 or any other available port ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
JWT_SECRET=secret_password //whatever? 
```
